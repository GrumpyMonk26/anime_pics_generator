# anime_pics_generator

### Vanilla JavaScript project

#### Project description

##### Our project entails the creation of an anime picture generator, providing users with the ability to obtain a random anime picture along with its corresponding name. The finalized version of the project incorporates a button that retrieves data from an API, instantly displaying a random anime picture and its name upon clicking. Upon clicking the 'Get anime' button, an engaging loading effect is observed, followed by the appearance of a new picture accompanied by a randomly generated name. Throughout the development process, we will gain expertise in utilizing APIs to fetch data, employing the try and catch method for error handling. Additionally, we will enhance our skills in CSS by crafting an aesthetically pleasing user interface, which includes customizing the background color of the page.
